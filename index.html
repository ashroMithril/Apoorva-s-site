I love you pappa , you are the best Papa possible ever<br><br>
You have always been there when I needed you , you are not only my pappa but also my bestie :) .I am going to rewind some important events of our lives .
			<ul>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">My Hero </span>: </li>
				<br>
		Iron man would have thought of his shields before entering the garden that day , when the shed was set into fire , but you were the one who without thinking about yourself went there .Let me tell you something that I was never scared of your partially burned face but the blankness on my face was because I was amazed to see your heroism and love and care for the family . I respect you a lot and you are the one who gives me strength at times 		<li>

 <span class="raleway-light">Your stories</span>: I can't believe you were so naughty at times , I have lived your life through your words and waiting for many more to come when we meet next time ;) </li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Portfolio</span>: Well I think we should have a portfolio someday and you should try to smile a bit more in those photos :P  ,,,, I only have one good <span id="pic-text"><u>picture</u></span> with you </li>
