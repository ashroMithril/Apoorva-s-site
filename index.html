<p>He caught my hand when the street was alarming and I had lost my way , and I just followed him in silence ..... observing ..... a thwart amongst so many noises.....

All big boxes with four wheels below , having a multiorganal specie sitting inside[who doesn't have any control over her/his own organs but] trying to control the four wheels because she thinks that she owns them and can control,why is that so that we can control the things we 'own'[don't we own our emotions as well] ,These boxes are running in a hastle from one side of the road to the other with 'focused' lights but none of them actually know there destination..... 

Someone holding another small box near his ear , promising his daughter that he would be on time for her performance {is coming to her Annual function 'in a minute' and} , he knows he will not be there on time to cheer her while performing but still is trying to reach there to catch her after her performance , to hug her and say that she's the best dancer ever .

The otherone on a box with only 'two' wheels but having 'too' many dreams inside a very unreal place i.e. their HEART (^) . Desires kills and expectations are the culprit , And we work under these bombs which blasts us after every victory and defeat . When we win the culprit actually gets an upgradation to kill us some more and when you loose it , there is nothing much to say , but 'they' console .

The luckiest one was the one with his beloved , holding his hands and changing the gears of life together . 

There was another one without a box walking orthogonally having some pieces of paper , I love a subject called 'MATH's , and my calculation told me he had the same pieces as I did . But we both were going to use it differently , he might buy sugar and tea for tomorrow after buying vegetables and I might spent them on a pizza with a tooty-frooty ice-cream . He must be wondering about his daughter's school fees ,  moving the three pieces clockwise that's how the clock moves but not his boss's ego . 

The best box , waiting for me on the otherside of the road had two nuts which screw me even on the phone :P , they were waiting for me since hrs , they had stars in their eyes [spark of getting their gifts asap]</p>
