UPDATE: Submitted two extended abstracts to CHI '15.<br><br>
Hi! I'm a senior year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna. I enjoy doing a lot of things, which include the following in no particular order:
			<ul>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Reading</span>: My favorite novelist is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erle_Stanley_Gardner" target="_blank">Erle Stanley Gardner</a> for his Perry Mason series (always was, and probably always will be). Sadly, I haven't been doing a lot of casual reading in recent times. </li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Listening to Music</span>: I like listening to Linkin Park, Eminem, One Republic, Taylor Swift, Maroon 5 and many more artists. I also enjoy listening to dubstep, an electronic dance music genre. These days, I'm listening to new artists like Zella Day, Echosmith and Dylan Gardner. </li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Watching Movies and TV Shows</span>: There are so many movies I love! Some of my favorites are The Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects and The Silence of the Lambs. Among TV shows, I like watching Suits, Anger Management and The Big Bang Theory. </li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Playing</span>: I enjoy playing soccer, table-tennis and chess. Oh, by the way, I once met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viswanathan_Anand" target="_blank">Viswanathan Anand</a>, 5-time World Chess Championship winner, on an airplane and got a <span id="pic-text"><u>picture</u></span> with him! </li>
			</ul>

			I have worked on several projects, some as part of a team and others on my own:
			<ul>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Knowledge Accelerator</span>: This is an ongoing project directed by <a href="http://kittur.org" target="_blank">Dr. Aniket Kittur</a> at the <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a>. The Knowledge Accelerator is a system that makes the crowd synthesize answers to questions asked by users using information present on the web. I worked closely with Dr. Kittur and Andrew Peters, the lead programmer of the project, on studying whether the quality of clips of text obtained from the crowd in one of the tasks in the system's workflow can be predicted using any known or calculable parameters, so as to guide refinements to the system. We developed a new task to obtain ratings for clips from the crowd and we ran the task on Amazon's <a href="http://www.mturk.com" target="_blank">Mechanical Turk</a> to obtain ratings for several clips we had already gotten from the crowd for a test question. We used average clip rating as a measure of its crowd-perceived quality and studied how well it correlates with two clip parameters.</li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Get 'em Moles!, </span><span class="raleway-light">Bublz!</span>: <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/MoleGame" target="_blank">Get 'em Moles!</a> & <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/Bublz" target="_blank">Bublz!</a> are single-player games created in a team of 5 mentored by <a href="http://amyogan.com" target="_blank">Dr. Amy Ogan</a> & <a href="http://www.erikharpstead.net" target="_blank">Erik Harpstead</a> from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon</a> and <a href="http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/ewalker/" target="_blank">Dr. Erin Walker</a> from <a href="http://www.asu.edu" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a> using the Unity game engine during a 15-day winter internship program in December 2013 at Bangalore, India.</li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">Nash Equilibria for Road Networks</span>: I developed a N-player <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/GameSolver" target="_blank">strategic form game solver</a> in Java and <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/RoadNetwork" target="_blank">extended it</a> to find the optimal distribution of traffic in simplistic road networks. I was mentored by <a href="http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/hari/" target="_blank">Dr. Y. Narahari</a>, Chairman, <a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Automation</a>, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.</li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">testsort</span>: <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/testsort" target="_blank">testsort</a> is a script I wrote to perform a comparative analysis of the increase in the run-times of various sorting algorithms with increase in input size.</li>
				<br>
				<li> <span class="raleway-light">32-bit Processor</span>: A simple 32-bit processor that supports MIPS-like instructions. Written in Verilog. Link: <a href="http://g-karthik.github.io/32BitMIPSProcessor" target="_blank">g-karthik.github.io/32BitMIPSProcessor</a></li>
